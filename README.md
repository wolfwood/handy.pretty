KiCAD footprints for use on reversable (keyboard adjacent) PCBs. Since PCB houses typically have a MOQ of 5, its better to design split keyboard PCBs that can be flipped over for left/right hand use, rather than fabbing a design for each half seperately. This also saves on design effort.

## Footprints

### Components
* Reversable_Diode_SOD-123_THT - a reversable diode footprint with both throughhole and SMD pads. This gives you maximum flexiblity in assembly. You can pay for PCBA, use a hot air station, or hand solder as apropriate, wtihout switching designs.
